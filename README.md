Itâ€™s time to create a basic computer graphics project!
so long helps me to improve skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, and textures.
Used the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! 
This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
